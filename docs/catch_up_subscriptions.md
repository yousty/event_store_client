# Catch-up subscriptions

Subscriptions allow you to subscribe to a stream and receive notifications about new events added to the stream.

You provide an event handler and an optional starting point to the subscription. The handler is called for each event from the starting point onward.

If events already exist, the handler will be called for each event one by one until it reaches the end of the stream. From there, the server will notify the handler whenever a new event appears.

## Subscribing from the start

When you need to process all the events in the store, including historical events, you need to subscribe from the beginning. You can either subscribe to receive events from a single stream, or subscribe to `$all` if you need to process all events in the database.

### Subscribing to a stream

The most simple stream subscription looks like the following:

```ruby
handler = proc do |event|
  p event
end
EventStoreClient.client.subscribe_to_stream('some-stream', handler: handler)
```

The provided handler will be called for every event in the stream. You may provide **any** object that responds to `#call`:

```ruby
class SomeStreamHandler
  def call(event)
    p event
  end
end
EventStoreClient.client.subscribe_to_stream('some-stream', handler: SomeStreamHandler.new)
```

### Subscribing to $all

Subscribing to `$all` is much the same as subscribing to a single stream. The handler will be called for every event appended after the starting position.

```ruby
handler = proc do |event|
  p event
end
EventStoreClient.client.subscribe_to_all(handler: handler)
```

## Subscribing from a specific position

The previous examples will subscribe to the stream from the beginning. This will end up calling the handler for every event in the stream and then wait for new events after that.

Both the stream and $all subscriptions accept a starting position if you want to read from a specific point onward. If events already exist at the position you subscribe to, they will be read on the server side and sent to the subscription.

Once caught up, the sever will push any new events received on the streams to the client. There is no difference between catching up and live on the client side.

### Subscribing to a stream

To subscribe to a stream from a specific position, you need to provide a _stream position_. This can be `:start`, `:end` or an integer position.

The following subscribes to the stream `some-stream` at position `20`, this means that events `21` and onward will be handled:

```ruby
EventStoreClient.client.subscribe_to_stream('some-stream', handler: proc { |event| }, options: { from_revision: 20 })
```

### Subscribing to $all

Subscribing to the `$all` stream is much like subscribing to a regular stream. The only difference is how you need to specify the stream position. For the `$all` stream, you have to provide the `:from_position` hash, which consists of two integers, `:commit_position` and `:prepare_position`. The `:from_position` value can accept `:start` and `:end` values as well.

The following `$all` subscription will subscribe from the event after the one at commit position `1056` and prepare position `1056`:

```ruby
EventStoreClient.client.subscribe_to_all(handler: proc { |event| }, options: { from_position: { commit_position: 1056, prepare_position: 1056 } })
```

Please note that the given position needs to be a legitimate position in the `$all` stream.

## Subscribing to a stream for live updates

You can subscribe to a stream to get live updates by subscribing to the end of the stream:

```ruby
EventStoreClient.client.subscribe_to_stream('some-stream', handler: proc { |event| }, options: { from_revision: :end })
```

And the same works with `$all` :

```ruby
EventStoreClient.client.subscribe_to_all(handler: proc { |event| }, options: { from_position: :end })
```

This won't read through the history of the stream, but will rather notify the handler when a new event appears in the respective stream.

Keep in mind that when you subscribe to a stream from a certain position - you will also get live updates after your subscription catches up (processes all the historical events).

## Resolving link-to's

Link-to events point to events in other streams in EventStoreDB. These are generally created by projections such as the `$by_event_type` projection which links events of the same event type into the same stream. This makes it easier to look up all events of a certain type.

When reading a stream you can specify whether to resolve link-to's or not. By default, link-to events are not resolved. You can change this behaviour by setting the `resolve_link_tos` option to `true`:

```ruby
EventStoreClient.client.subscribe_to_stream('$et-myEventType', handler: proc { |event| }, options: { resolve_link_tos: true })
```

## Handling subscription drops

An application, which hosts the subscription, can go offline for a period of time for different reasons. It could be a crash, infrastructure failure, or a new version deployment. As you rarely would want to reprocess all the events again, you'd need to store the current position of the subscription somewhere, and then use it to restore the subscription from the point where it dropped off:

```ruby
checkpoint = :start
handler = proc do |event|
  handle_event(event)
  checkpoint = event.stream_revision  
end

EventStoreClient.client.subscribe_to_stream('some-stream', handler: handler, options: { from_revision: checkpoint })
```

When subscribed to `$all` you want to keep the position of the event in the `$all` stream. As mentioned previously, the `$all` stream position consists of two integers (prepare and commit positions), not one:

```ruby
checkpoint = :start
handler = proc do |event|
  handle_event(event)
  checkpoint = { prepare_position: event.prepare_position, commit_position: event.commit_position }
end

EventStoreClient.client.subscribe_to_all(handler: handler, options: { from_position: checkpoint })
```

### Checkpoints and other responses

By default `event_store_client` will skip such EventStore DB responses as checkpoints, confirmations, etc. If you would like to handle them in the subscription handler, you can provide the `skip_deserialization` keyword argument, and then handle deserialization by yourself:

```ruby
checkpoint = :start
handler = proc do |raw_response|
  if raw_response.checkpoint
    handle_checkpoint(raw_response.checkpoint)
  else
    event = EventStoreClient::GRPC::Shared::Streams::ProcessResponse.new(config: EventStoreClient.config).call(
      raw_response,
      false,
      false
    )
    handle_event(event) if event
  end
end

EventStoreClient.client.subscribe_to_all(handler: handler, options: { from_position: checkpoint }, skip_deserialization: true)
```

## User credentials

The user creating a subscription must have read access to the stream it's subscribing to, and only admin users may subscribe to `$all` or create filtered subscriptions.

The code below shows how you can provide user credentials for a subscription. When you specify subscription credentials explicitly, it will override the default credentials set for the client. If you don't specify any credentials, the client will use the credentials specified for the client, if you specified those.

```ruby
EventStoreClient.client.subscribe_to_stream('some-stream', handler: proc { |event| }, credentials: { username: 'admin', password: 'changeit' })
```

## Server-side filtering

EventStoreDB allows you to filter the events whilst you subscribe to the `$all` stream so that you only receive the events that you care about.

You can filter by event type or stream name using either a regular expression or a prefix. Server-side filtering is currently only available on the `$all` stream.

A simple stream prefix filter looks like this:

```ruby
EventStoreClient.client.subscribe_to_all(handler: proc { |event| }, options: { filter: { stream_identifier: { prefix: ['test-', 'other-'] } } })
```

### Filtering out system events

There are a number of events in EventStoreDB called system events. These are prefixed with a `$` and under most circumstances you won't care about these. They can be filtered out by event type.

```ruby
EventStoreClient.client.subscribe_to_all(handler: proc { |event| }, options: { filter: { event_type: { regex: /^[^\$].*/.to_s } } })
```

### Filtering by event type

If you only want to subscribe to events of a given type there are two options. You can either use a regular expression or a prefix.

#### Filtering by prefix

This will only subscribe to events with a type that begin with `customer-`:

```ruby
EventStoreClient.client.subscribe_to_all(handler: proc { |event| }, options: { filter: { event_type: { prefix: ['customer-'] } } })
```

#### Filtering by regular expression

If you want to subscribe to multiple event types then it might be better to provide a regular expression. This will subscribe to any event that begins with `user` or `company`:

```ruby
EventStoreClient.client.subscribe_to_all(handler: proc { |event| }, options: { filter: { event_type: { regex: '^user|^company' } } })
```

### Filtering by stream name

If you only want to subscribe to a stream with a given name there are two options. You can either use a regular expression or a prefix.

#### Filtering by prefix

This will only subscribe to all streams with a name that begins with `user-`:

```ruby
EventStoreClient.client.subscribe_to_all(handler: proc { |event| }, options: { filter: { stream_identifier: { prefix: ['user-'] } } })
```

#### Filtering by regular expression

If you want to subscribe to multiple streams then it might be better to provide a regular expression.

```ruby
EventStoreClient.client.subscribe_to_all(handler: proc { |event| }, options: { filter: { stream_identifier: { regex: '^account|^savings' } } })
```
